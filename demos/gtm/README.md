## Overview

This PromptQL project provides AI-powered analytics for Go-To-Market (GTM) operations, focusing on sales performance, revenue forecasting, and pipeline management.

**What problem does it solve?**

- Transforms complex sales data into actionable insights without requiring SQL expertise
- Enables sales leaders to quickly analyze pipeline health, forecast accuracy, and team performance
- Automates revenue operations reporting and identifies growth opportunities

**Key features and capabilities:**

- Real-time pipeline analytics and coverage analysis
- Sales performance tracking and quota attainment monitoring
- Competitive win/loss analysis
- Territory and market potential assessment
- Deal velocity and sales cycle optimization

## Getting Started

To use this GTM PromptQL agent effectively:

1. Start with simple queries about current pipeline or recent performance
2. Progress to more complex analyses involving correlations and predictions
3. Use natural language - no technical knowledge required

## Sample Evaluation Prompts
